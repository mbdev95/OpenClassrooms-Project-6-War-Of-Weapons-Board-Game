- jQuery
- CSS grid

## Introduction
Project 6 of my OpenClassrooms Front-end web developer course has greatly deepended my understanding of JavaScript by using object-oriented JavaScript to create a turn-based board game.  I learned the importance of using object-oriented JavaScript to create organized JavaScript code which can be compartmentalized into organized object classes allowing for a controlled flow of data in a logical way.  Moreover, I learned and used jQuery syntax to allow for more efficient programming using a more concise verson of JavaScript. I used conditional statements throughout to create precise code which only executes under the specific conditions the board game requires.  Project 6 greatly increased my confidence in the world of JavaScript.

## User-Interface

The user-interface was created using mostly custom css with the assistance of bootstrap to allow for more efficient design. The board was created using the css grid properties of grid-template-rows and grid-template-columms to create one hundred equally sized boxes in ten rows and columns.  Meanwhile, each grid item was given a flex display value so any grid item's contents could be centered using the justify-content and align-items value of center.  Above the board a rectangle of svg weapons was positioned using absolute positioning.  The weapons move slightly when hovered over as a result of css transition and tranforms.  To the left and right of the board are column of four banners displayed using flex-column, while the contents of each banner are displayed using relative positioning.  Thus, on this project I used a diverse selection of css layout methods including absolute positioning, relative positioning, flexbox and the css grid.
